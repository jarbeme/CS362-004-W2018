Bug-Reports
For the smithy card the number of cards that should be drawn was too low, this could be due to the card counter being incremented to one instead of zero which is what it should be. This causes the number of cards that are supposed to drawn to be less than what the card is supposed to draw. This is an interesting one and a pretty simple bug to place into the program. I actually placed a similar bug into my program. From prior coding experience initializing a variable to the wrong value is a pretty common bug that gets created. This has happened to me many times during my other classes in this program. 
For the second bug that I had to find this one was much more difficult to find. In the card great hall there is a wrong variable instead of the variable state my group member placed handPos. This caused me some issues since it would allow the card to work correctly some of the time and some of the time it would work incorrectly. This bug actually drove me a little crazy and eventually the only way that I confirmed the existence of this bug was to actually go line by line looking at the code and finding the issue. I found this bug to be interesting and very difficult.
